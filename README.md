Ada Spark project implements a Fire Alarm System designed to enhance safety in buildings. The system is programmed to detect elevated temperatures that exceed predefined thresholds, triggering alarms and notifications to alert occupants.
Document accompanies the project, detailing functional requirements, a functional block diagram, an FMECA worksheet, fault tree analysis, and a reliability block diagram to support the development and understanding of the system.
